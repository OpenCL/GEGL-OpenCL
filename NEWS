                 ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺

Changes in GEGL 0.1.2
⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
 • GeglLookup, configurable floating point lookup tables for lazy computation.
 • Use GFileIOStream in GeglTileBackendFile.
 • Optimizations: in-place processing for point filters/composers,
     SIMD version of gegl:opacity, avoid making unneccesary sub-buffers,
     removed some  manual instrumentation from critical paths, improved
     speed of samplers.
 • Added xml composition/reference image based regression tests.
 • Added performance tracking framework.
 • Syntactic sugar using varargs for constructing gegl graphs from C.
 • Build fixes on cygwin, 
 • Gegl# fixes.
 • Initial, but unstable code towards multithreading.
 • Improvements to lua op in workshop.
 • Added new resamplers upsize, upsharp, upsmooth, downsize, downsharp and
   downsmooth.
 • Removed gegl:tonemap and gegl:normal ops.

Changes in GEGL 0.1.0
⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
 • Renamed gegl:load-buffer to gegl:buffer-source and gegl:save-buffer
   to gegl:buffer-sink (but the old names still work)
 • Represent colors using doubles instead of floats (this change is
   independent from internal processing)
 • Removed the GTK+ UI parts of the gegl binary and turned gegl into a
   pure command line tool (which can still visualize stuff with help
   help the SDL based display operation)
 • Consider {x=G_MININT/2, y=G_MININT/2, width=G_MAXINT, height=G_MAXINT}
   as the only valid region wichin processing may occur. Processing
   outside of this region is undefined behaviour.
 • Added support for storing allocation stack traces for GeglBuffers
   so that debuging buffer leaks becomes much easier
 • Made small changes and cleanups of the public API, e.g.
   • Removed gegl_node_adapt_child()
   • Made GeglConfig an explicit object
   • Removed most of the ifdeffed stuff to mask away internal
     structures
   • Added gegl_rectangle_infinite_plane() and
     gegl_rectangle_is_infinite_plane()
 • Added new sampler GeglSamplerSharp
 • Added format property go gegl:buffer-sink
 • Cleaned up and made gegl:introspect work again
 • Add a bunch of test cases using the automake test sytem (make check)
   and also port buffer tests to automake
 • General cleanups, bug fixes, increased robustness and improved
   documentation

Changes in GEGL 0.0.22
⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
 • GeglOperation
   • operation names are now prefixed, the ops in GEGL use 'gegl:' as prefix.
   • gegl:opacity - combine value and aux mask input when both are available.
   • gegl:src-in - deal correctly with extens.
   • gegl:path - new op covering the stroke/fill needs of SVG.
   • deprecated gegl:shift, the affine familiy of operations now 
     uses the same fast code paths for integer translations.
 • GeglBuffer
   • Profiling motivated speed ups in data reading/writing.
   • Remove left-over swapfiles from dead processes at startup.
 • GeglNode
   • made gegl_node_add_child and gegl_node_remove_child public API. (#507298)
 • GeglPath
   Vector path representation infrastructure, supporting poly lines and beziers
   by default, the infrastructure allows extensions from applications with
   other curve types (smooth curves, spiro curves and others.).

Changes in GEGL 0.0.18
⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
 • Configuration both from commandline arguments and at runtime.
 • GeglBuffer
   • New raw tiled raster file format, used both as swap and stored buffers.

     using a new data type /g4float/ that allows writing CPU agnostic vectorized
     code for GCC.
   • New temporal filter base class, for operations operating on color values from
     neighbouring frames in a video stream.
   • Autogenerated operation reference installed for use with devhelp.
   • New operations: write-buffer, v4l, color-temperature.
