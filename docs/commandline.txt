----------------

In addition to installing a library, GEGL also installs gegl - a binary/program
that permits doing image processing from the commandline as well as an aid
during development of GEGL operations.

Some examples:

Render a composition to a PNG file, the composition can be in GEGLs XML format
or the one-liner friendly terser link:gegl-chain.html[gegl-chain] format.

 $ gegl composition -o composition.png
