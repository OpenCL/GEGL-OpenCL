GEGL image processing
---------------------

  - Floating point handling and processing and output of larger 8bit, 16bit
    integer and 32bit floating point per component buffers larger than RAM.

  - C based, object oriented API with introspection support for dynamic
    languages like python, ruby, javascript and php.

  - Processing
     * Iterative chunk-wise processing.
     * Processes subregions and dependencies.
     * Subgraph caches to aid performance of non-destructive editing.
     * Multi-threaded processing.
     * OpenCL acceleration, capable of hybrid cpu/gpu processing.
     * Experimental mipmap preview rendering, do zoomed out preview 
       rendering touching only 25% 6.25% of the pixels.

     * Storage of all babl supported formats.
     * Sparse swapped buffers (larger than RAM images).
     * linear buffers (allocated internally or from external allocation.)
     * On demand tiled mipmapping.
     * Thread-safe reading/writing.
     * External tile-backends (allow wrapping other tiled buffer systems
       to use them through the GeglBuffer API).
     * Most operations operate in
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScRGB_color_space[scRGB] (using 32bit
       floating point/HDR linear light RGBA), operations use babl formats to
       specify whether data should be linearized for processing.
  - Bounding box based hit detection.
  - XML serialization format (not-finalized)
